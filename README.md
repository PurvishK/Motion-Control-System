# Motion-Control-System

Over the past few decades, computing systems have undergone substantial change. 
Additionally, there has been an improvement in how people connect with machines. 
Simple keyboard inputs to sophisticated vision-based gesture recognition systems 
are all examples of Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) techniques.

This project is a mouse simulation system that mimics your hand movements and gestures 
to carry out all the actions your mouse would normally carry out. Simply put, a camera records your video,
and you may move the cursor, make a left click, right click, drag, select, and up and down scroll depending on your hand motions.
